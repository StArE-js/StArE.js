puerto rico’s complicated history with the united states
in february 1898, puerto ricans had a lot to celebrate. after centuries of spanish colonial rule, they had just become an independent part of spain, complete with a constitution and voting rights. but within only a few years, the u.s. would throw all that asunder, paving the way for puerto rico&#x2019;s nonvoting territory status today.
it all started with the spanish-american war, which began in the spring of 1898, when puerto rico was a spanish territory. the u.s. invaded puerto rico not only because it was a spanish territory, but also due to its interests in developing a sugar market there, says after they won the war, when spain ceded puerto rico to the u.s. in the treaty of paris. the u.s. ignored the new, democratically-elected local parliament of puerto rico in favor of creating its own colonial system.

with the westward expansion of the 19th century, the u.s. established &#x201c;incorporated territories&#x201d; that could and did become formal american states&#x2014;like the colorado territory. but in 1901, a series of legal opinions known as the insular cases argued that puerto rico and other territories ceded by the spanish were full of &#x201c;alien 
in addition, the u.s. disrupted puerto rico&#x2019;s coffee industry, implementing a sugar economy and creating massive poverty among the population. &#x201c;within the first 10 years of the u.s. occupation of puerto rico, u.s. sugar interests had pretty much taken over, and the puerto rican coffee class has been displaced entirely,&#x201d; guerra explains. 
puerto ricans were outraged after the war. instead of becoming citizens, puerto ricans were in limbo. &#x201c;they didn&#x2019;t even have a passport; they didn&#x2019;t have any legal standing in the u.s. system until 1917.&#x201d;
that year, puerto ricans became u.s. citizens under the jones-shafroth act&#x2014;this way the u.s. could deploy them as troops during world war i (similar to how the emancipation proclamation legalized the union&#x
although they were now u.s. citizens, puerto ricans could not vote for president or elect voting senators or representatives to the u.s. congress. in fact, they still can&#x2019;t.

since 1901, puerto ricans have only been able to elect a nonvoting &#x201c;resident commissioner of puerto rico&#x201d; to the u.s. house of representatives. like the united states&#x2019; other territories of guam, northern mariana islands, the u.s. virgin islands, and american samoa, as well as the u.s. capital of pedro al
&#x201c;it&#x2019;s still a country that is dominated by u.s. investors,&#x201d; guerra says. &#x201c;and you should know that most u.s. companies pay virtually no taxes to the puerto rican state.&#x201d; this combined with the local government&#x2019;s massive corruption has created an economic crisis. in september 2017, these economic problems supreme court.
