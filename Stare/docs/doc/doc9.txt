abstract
the accumulation of chlorophenols (cps) in the environment, due to their wide use as agrochemicals, has become a serious environmental
                     problem. these organic halides can be degraded by aerobic microorganisms, where the initial steps of various biodegradation
                     pathways include an oxidative dechlorinating process in which chloride is replaced by a hydroxyl substituent. harnessing these
                     dechlorinating processes could provide an opportuni
