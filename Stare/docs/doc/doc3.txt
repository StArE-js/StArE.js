hada awards $375,000 in scholarships to houston students
houston (august 22, 2016) &#8211; the houston automobile dealers association (hada) issued $375,000 in scholarships to 126 deserving college students this week, providing financial support to houston area dealership employees, their dependents and students enrolled in automotive youth educational systems.
two students whose parents work at classic chevrolet sugar land received $3,000 scholarships to attend college. both hanna kirby and hunter kolon will enter their first year of university in dallas this fall.
kirby will attend the university of texas-dallas to study accounting. she also plans to play lacrosse and rush for a sorority her first year.
“my older sister is also at ut dallas, so this scholarship greatly helps my parents in covering both our tuitions at the same time,” said kirby. “thanks to this scholarship, i’m excited to be studying with her instead of having to attend a junior college before a major university.”
hunter will attend southern methodist university this fall studying human rights and pre-law.
“i’m excited to receive a scholarship that will ease the financial burden of college,” said hunter. “i’m now prepared and as ready as i’ll ever be to study and work toward by educational goals.”
