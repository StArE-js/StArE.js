description[edit]
vaquitas are the smallest and most endangered species of the infraorder cetacea and are endemic to the northern end of the gulf of california. the vaquita is somewhat stocky and has a characteristic porpoise shape. the species is distinguishable by the dark rings surrounding their eyes, patches on their lips, and a line that extends from their dorsal fins to their mouths. their backs are a dark grey that fades to white undersides. as vaquitas mature, the shades of grey lighten.behavior[edit]
vaquitas use high-pitched sounds to communicate with one another and for echolocation to navigate through their habitats. they generally feed and swim at a leisurely pace. vaquitas avoid boats and are very evasive. they rise to breathe with a slow, forward motion and then disappear quickly. this lack of activity at the surface makes them difficult to observe.[edit]
like other phocoena, vaquitas are usually seen singly. if they are seen together, it is usually in small groups of two or three individuals.&#91;26&#93; less often, groups around ten have been observed, with the most ever seen at once being 40 individuals.&#91;diet[edit]
vaquitas tend to forage near lagoons.&#91;26&#93; all of the 17 fish species found in vaquita stomachs can be classified as demersal and or benthic species inhabiting relatively shallow water in the upper gulf of calif
life cycle and reproduction[edit]
little is known about the life cycle of vaquitas. age at sexual maturity, longevity, reproductive cycle and population dynamics estimates have been made, but further research is needed. most of these estimates come from vaquitas that have been stranded or caught in nets. some are based on other porpoise species similar to vaquitas.

vaquitas are estimated to live about 20 years in ideal conditions.&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93; they mature sexually at 1.3 m long, as early as 3 years old, but more likely at 6. reproduction occurs during late spring or early summer. their gestation period is between 10 and 11 months. they have season
distribution and habitat[edit]
the habitat of the vaquita is restricted to the northern area of the gulf of california, or sea of cortez.&#91;38&#93; they live in shallow, murky lagoons along shorelines. they rarely swim deeper than 30&#160;m (100&#160;ft) and are known to survive in lagoons so shallow that their backs protrude above
conservation[edit]
the vaquita is considered the most endangered of 129 extant marine mammal species.&#91;39&#93; it has been classified as one of the top 100 evolutionary distinct and globally endangered (edge) mammals in the world.&#91;26&#93; the vaquita is an evolutionarily 
population decline[edit]
vaquitas have never been hunted directly, but their population is declining, largely because of animals becoming trapped in illegal gillnets intended for capturing the totoaba, a large critically endangered fish of the drum family endemic to the gulf. a trade in totoaba swim bladders has arisen, driven by demand from china (where they are u
estimates placed the vaquita population at 567 in 1997.&#91;38&#93; estimates in the 2000s ranged between 150&#91;40&#93;&#91;41&#93; to 300.&#91;42&#93; inbreeding depression has probably begun to affect the fitness of the species, potentially contributing to the population's further decline.&#91;6&#93; an international vaquita recovery team concluded that the population is decreasing at a rate of 18.5% per year, and "the species will soon be extinct unless drastic steps are taken immediately."&#91;7&#93; their report recommende
on 16 april 2015, enrique peña nieto, president of mexico, announced a program to conserve and protect the vaquita and the similar-sized totoaba, including a two-year ban on gillnet fishing in the area, patrols by the mexican navy and financial support to fishermen impacted by the plan. – cetacean specialist group reported that the vaquita population had dipped to around 60 remaining individuals in 2015. this represents a 92% decline from the 1997 population level. in march 2016 alone, at least three vaquitas drowned after being entangled in gillnets set for totoaba.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; this
by march 2018, an interview with the watchdog group elephant action league revealed that based on recordings of vaquita calls from multiple sources, there were likely only a dozen remaining vaquita in the region. according to the interview, despite the recent efforts to curb poaching, dozens of poachers have still been seen fishing every night. it remains unlikely that the population will survive the next totoaba fishing season, which began around the same time the interview was released.&#91;14&#93;

primary threats[edit]
accidental drowning in gillnets set by fishermen meant for catching totoaba is the primary cause of anthropogenic, incidental mortality for the vaquita. three fishing villages in the northern gulf of california are primarily involved in the totoaba fishery and, as a result, most directly involved in threats to the vaquita. san felipe, in baja california, and golfo de santa clara and puerto peñasco, in sonora, have a total population of approximately 61,000. up to 80% of the economy in these town
studies performed in el golfo de santa clara, one of the three major ports in which vaquitas live, indicated that gillnet fishing caused about 39 vaquita deaths a year in the late 1990s. this was close to 17% of the whole vaquita population within this port. while these results were not taken from the entire range of habitat in which vaquitas live, it is reasonable to assume that these results can be applied to the whole vaquita population, and in fact may even be a little low. has reduced the flow of fresh water into the gulf, though there is no empirical evidence that the reduced flow from the upper colorado river has posed an immediate short-te
a 2018 interview indicated that the illegal fishermen may be waiting for the species to go extinct in order to fish with fewer restrictions.&#91;11&#93;

secondary impact of declining numbers[edit]
though the major cause of vaquita porpoise mortality is bycatch in gillnets, as numbers continue to dwindle, new problems will arise that will tend to make recovery more difficult. one such problem is reduced breeding rates. with fewer individuals in the habitat, less contact will occur between the sexes and consequently less reproduction. this may be followed by increased inbreeding and reduced genetic variability in the inbreeding depression occurs, the population experiences reduced fitness because deleterious recessive genes can manifest in the population. in small populations where genetic variability is low, individuals are 
ecological consequences[edit]
removal of the vaquita will have a significant ecological impact on the northern gulf of california. the gulf of california is considered a large marine ecosystem, due to its high species diversity and large habitat size.&#91;58&#93; with such &#91;58&#93; although the vaquita accounts for only a small percentage of the diets of sharks in the region, extinction of the vaquita could potentially cause negative effects on shark population sizes
conservation efforts for the vaquita are mainly focused on fishing restrictions to prevent their bycatch. these fishing restrictions could prove beneficial for the fish in the upper gulf, as well as the vaquita. as a result of increased restrictions on gillnet use, the populations of the targeted fish and shrimp species will receive protection from overfishing.&#91;59&#93; historically, numerous recovery efforts[edit]
because vaquitas are endemic to the gulf of california, mexico is leading conservation efforts with the creation of the international committee for the recovery of the vaquita (cirva), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat.&#91;26&#93; cirva has worked with the cites, the &#91;60&#93; the nacap is a strategy to support mexico's efforts to recover the vaquita. also in 2008, mexico launched the program pace-vaquita, another effort to help preserve the sp
in the rent-out option, fishermen acquire temporary contractual obligations to carry out conservation efforts. they are paid if they agree to terminate their fishing inside the vaquita refuge area. there is a penalty if fishermen breach the contract which includes getting their vessels taken by the government. the switch-out option provides fishermen with compensation for switching to vaquita-safe harvesting technology. finally, the buy-back program compensates fisherman for permanently turning 
in november 2014, greenpeace uk launched a campaign urging its members to write to president peña nieto to extend the vaquita reserve to the full range of the species, as well as commence dialogue with the chinese and us over the commercial transport and consumption of products from species that threaten the vaquita's future, such as the similarly sized totoaba fish which is used in cynoscion othonopterus) in the area of the vaquita's habitat, in an attempt to halt the decline in population. in december 2015, sea shepherd conservation society launched &#91;65&#93
since these measures failed to halt the decline, by february 2017 it was judged that a program placing a portion of the remaining population in protective captivity was needed to save the species. additional measures considered necessary were extending a permanent gillnet ban to the legal curvina fishery (which can provide cover for the illegal totoaba fishery), improving the enforcement of fisheries regulations and increasing penalties for violations, and accelerated development of alternative,
on 7 june 2017, it was announced by president peña nieto that the gillnet ban would be extended and made permanent.&#91;18&#93;&#91;67&#93; there will also be newly strengthened efforts to enforce the ban and prosecute violators. to discourage skirting the rules, 
while the permanent ban and increased fishing regulations, if properly enforced, will help preserve the vaquita population, they do not resolve the economic situation. the fishermen may rely on solely this business to make a living. the regulations do not address the traditions and livelihoods of the community that is dependent on fishing. programs are needed that educate members of the community about conservation and facilitate economic diversification. conservation groups have contributed to 
the proposal for a captive breeding program must contend with the general greater difficulty of keeping porpoises in captivity relative to dolphins, due to porpoises' sensitivity to disturbance and stress.&#91;69&#93; success in keeping captive porpoises has only been attained in recent years.&#91;71&#93;&#91;72&#93; on 6 november 2017, mexico's environmental minister announced that a female vaquita had been successfully captured a
recovery efforts have been deemed very slow and inadequate, with large amounts of poaching still going on, reducing the population to one dozen. sea shepherd and elephant action league are apparently the only organizations to have a constant presence in monitoring the population. reported that one of its boats patrolling the area to remove and deter the setting of illegal nets had been attacked by fishing boats for the second time in a month.&#91;77&#93; it has also been reported that the efforts of the mexican navy to deter illegal fishing have not been successful; th
