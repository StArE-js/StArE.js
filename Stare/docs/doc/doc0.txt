dear reader,
we're going big with a new mother jones corruption project, because we realized so many of today's stories come down to corruption: a system that is consistently manipulated by those with wealth and power. we aim to hire, build a team, and do time-intensive reporting to understand how we got here and how we might get out, publishing a major series of investigations in the summer of 2020. if you like how that sounds, please ceodonate
"corruption isn’t just another scandal. it’s the rot beneath all of them": that's where we explain why mother jones is going big with a new corruption project. we aim to hire, build a team, and do time-intensive reporting to understand corruption as a pattern, not just isolated incidents. if you like how that sounds, help us go all

with hurricane season looming, trump is blocking relief funds and mocking puerto rico
on monday, he tweeted that the island&#8217;s residents &#8220;should be very happy.&#8221;

damage in mexico beach, florida, after hurricane michael.gerald herbert/ap
in the two hurricane seasons since donald trump was elected president, the united states was hit by five major hurricanes, including hurricane maria, which devastated puerto rico in 2017. in the immediate aftermath of the record-breaking storm, trump accused the mayor of san juan of &#8220;poor leadership&#8221; and suggested puerto ricans weren&#8217;t doing enough to help themselves. nearly two years late
&#8230;.alabama, iowa, nebraska, georgia, south carolina, north carolina and others unless much more money is given to puerto rico. the dems don’t want farmers to get any help. puerto rico should be very happy and the dems should stop blocking much needed disaster relief!
&mdash; donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) may 6, 2019

his disdain for the island&nbsp;and its leadership has bled into a fight in the senate over disaster relief for victims of the 2018 hurricane season.
since march, congress has been working on an aid package to assist victims of recent floods, wildfires, and hurricanes. last october, the first category 5 hurricane since 1992&#8217;s hurricane andrew&nbsp; made landfall near mexico beach in the florida panhandle. seven months, 59 deaths, and $25 billion in damage later, congress has yet to send a relief package to the floridians affected by the 
&#8220;that whole bill is being jeopardized because of pettiness,&#8221; al cathey, the mayor of mexico beach, told the washington post last month.
in puerto rico, crumbling infrastructure was made worse by the powerful hurricane. a year and a half later, residents are still waiting on funds to repair hospitals, roads, and public schools. on the mainland, hurricane michael victims are also in dire straits. many residents in bay county, florida, home to mexico beach, are still livin
despite the sense of urgency in florida, the president seems intent on continuing the fight over puerto rico funding. he has repeatedly said that puerto rico has received $91 billion in aid, but that is far from reality. congress has allocated only $41 billion to puerto rico, and only a small fraction of that has been used because local government officials must detail how they taking steps toward finalizing a package. it signals that the white house isn&#8217;t ready to acquiesce to democrats&#8217; desire to include more funding for puerto rico. mean

one more thing
and it's a big one. mother jones is launching a new corruption project to do deep, time-intensive reporting on the corruption that is both the cause and result of the crisis in our democracy.
the more we thought about how mother jones can have the most impact right now, the more we realized that so many stories come down to corruption: people with wealth and power putting their interests first—and often getting away with it.
our goal is to understand how we got here and how we might get out. we're aiming to create a reporting position dedicated to uncovering corruption, build a team, and let them investigate for a year—publishing our stories in a concerted window: a special issue of our magazine, video and podcast series, and a dedicated online portal so they don't get lost in the daily deluge of headlines and breaking news. 
we want to go all in, and we've got seed funding to get started—but we're looking to raise $500,000 in donations this spring so we can go even bigger. you can read about why we think this project is what the moment demands and what we hope to accomplish—and if you like how it sound
